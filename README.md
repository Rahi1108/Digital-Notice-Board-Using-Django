The Digital Notice Board is a web-based application developed using the Django framework, designed to provide a simple and efficient way to display notices on a local system. Unlike traditional notice boards that rely on physical paper and pins, this digital solution allows notices to be created, managed, and viewed seamlessly through a web interface. The project is specifically tailored to run on a single Windows PC, making it ideal for small-scale, localized use cases such as a personal workspace, classroom, or small office.
Key Features:
1. Admin-Controlled Notice Creation
2. Public Viewing Access
3. Local Deployment
4. Simple and Intuitive Interface
Purpose and Use Case
The Digital Notice Board eliminates the need for repetitive logins or complex user management, focusing on simplicity and accessibility. It’s perfect for scenarios where a single person (the admin) needs to share updates—like announcements, reminders, or schedules—with a small group, all within a controlled environment like a personal computer.

Future Enhancements
While the current version meets basic requirements, potential upgrades could include:

Adding categories or filters for notices.

Enabling a basic scheduling feature to display notices at specific times.

Extending access to a local network for multi-device viewing.
